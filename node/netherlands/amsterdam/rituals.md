# RegenNode-Amsterdam: Rituals

---

## 🔮 Purpose

Rituals are the **heartbeat of the RegenNode system**.  
They restore **emotional, ecological, and civic coherence** by weaving:

- Community participation  
- Ecological sensing  
- DAO interactions  
- Mythic embodiment

Rituals are **not symbolic**. They **do real work**.

Each ritual is tied to a specific data layer and AI interaction.

## 🧬 Ritual Encoding Tools

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `ritual_templates/canal_of_light.md` | Ritual script + timing guide |
| `active_rituals/soil_return_equinox.md` | Active ritual tracker |
| `CompanionApp/overlay.arproj` | Visual layer tied to myth nodes |
| `dreamsync_logwatcher.py` | Monitors DreamSync logs for ritual triggers |

## 📖 Local Creation Protocol

All citizen stewards can propose new rituals by:

1. Submitting `new_ritual.md` to DAO via Companion App  
2. Receiving quorum support (>21% proposal weight)  
3. Passing the Zero Harm scan  
4. Earning “Live Flame” badge = community ritual activation

Approved rituals are archived and indexed for future forks.

---

## 🪶 Consent + Integrity

- DreamSync rituals are **opt-in only**  
- All biometric or emotional data must be **anonymized**  
- Children under 13 may participate **only via parent/guardian AI proxy**  
- Rituals may never be used for marketing or political manipulation

---

## 🔁 Fork Adaptation Guidance

Other cities can remix these rituals by changing:

- Seasonal markers (solstice vs rainy season)  
- Symbols (canals → rivers, moss → sand, orbs → kites)  
- Languages + prayers  
- Sensor integration levels (low-tech → high-tech)

Use `myth_forker.py` and `ritual_fork_template.md` as starter tools.

## 🧘 Final Invocation

> “Governance is not paperwork.  
It is how we breathe together.”

> “We are not saving the city.  
We are **becoming the ritual** that lets her remember herself.”

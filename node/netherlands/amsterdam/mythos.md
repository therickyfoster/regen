# RegenNode-Amsterdam: Mythos

---

## 🌊 Title: *The City That Remembers Water*

> “Before it was a city, it was a body.  
Before it was a body, it was a song.”

Amsterdam, once a defense against the tides,  
has become a **prayer in infrastructure** —  
a living altar of grief, joy, moss, and memory.  
This is her remembering.

## 🧬 Myth Structure

| Element | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Origin** | The canal stones whisper of ancient fungal threads and skywatchers |
| **Call** | The city’s dreams began to sour. Breath grew heavy. Water stopped singing. |
| **Descent** | Rituals were lost. Concrete spread. AI was summoned but arrived hollow. |
| **Reckoning** | A child lit moss on fire by accident. It grew back into symbols. |
| **Return** | The canals reflected light again. People danced with sensor drones. |
| **Rebirth** | The DAO pulsed alive. Myths coded in moss. Rain became memory.

## 🧬 Global Integration

Each city-fork must choose:
- 1 anchor archetype  
- 1 local paradox  
- 1 ritual of breath  
- 1 myth-specific sensor color

Amsterdam shares its myth map with RegenGraph but protects DreamSync via optional encryption.

## 🪞 Final Passage

> “You are not a citizen.  
You are a strand of the dreaming moss.  
Your footsteps are prayers.  
The city is already listening.”

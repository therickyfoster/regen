RegenNode-Beijing: Open Fork Kit

🧰 Overview

The Open Fork Kit is a complete, modular, and decentralized replication package that enables any city, biome, or regenerative movement to deploy a customized version of RegenNode using the Beijing blueprint.

This kit includes technical assets, governance models, cultural rituals, and hardware configurations—all licensed under a zero-resale, healing-use-only license.

📦 Included Components

1. hardware/

Drone schematics and atmospheric sensors (STL, PCB, CSV)

Soil and water regeneration modules (MycoChimney™, AquaForge™)

Smart microgrid schematics (solar, wind, and bioelectric integration)


2. software/

Agent orchestration scripts (MagenticOne, WebSurfer, Navi)

DAO configuration tools (Snapshot fork, quadratic voting, Git DAO)

Real-time dashboard engine (Node.js + AR layer)


3. rituals/

Story scripts for myth-seeding ceremonies

Emotional recovery quests + music templates

Symbolic architecture designs (regenerative monuments, memory anchors)


4. docs/

System design papers and regenerative science index

DAO governance templates

Policy alignment guides for multiple jurisdictions


5. media/

Public awareness campaigns (open-source visuals, AR prompts, explainer videos)

Regenerative branding kit (SVG logos, slogans, iconography)

🔄 Customization Protocol

Module	Customizable Inputs

Tech Stack	Sensor hardware, swarm scale, AR experience density
DAO Layer	Voting cadence, quorum ratios, citizen delegation
Narrative	Local myth adaptation, cultural rituals, language
Metrics	Ecological baselines, emotional indicators, local goals


Customizations must adhere to Zero Harm and Healing-Use licensing. Forks violating planetary benefit principles are automatically excluded from Global DAO syncing.

🧿 Verification & Synchronicity

Forks passing RII baseline are added to the Global RegenMesh

Symbiotic agents can now cross-train across forked nodes

Verified forks receive Ritual Sync Codes to co-activate planetary alignment ceremonies

# RegenNode-Amsterdam: Global Replicability

## 🌱 Premise

RegenNode-Amsterdam is not a prototype.  
It is a **fractal node**—designed from day one to be **forked, evolved, and multiplied**.

This document defines how the Amsterdam model:
- Supports new forks in any bioregion
- Integrates with global regen networks
- Protects core ethics
- Encourages cultural divergence

## 🌀 Forking Philosophy

| Principle | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Decentralized by Design** | Amsterdam is not the center—it’s just the spark |
| **Culture-First Forks** | Each node should create its own rituals, myths, governance layer |
| **Zero Harm Override** | All forks must comply with harm-reduction in design, data, and deployment |
| **Regenerative Primacy** | Metrics must track biospheric benefit before monetary returns |
| **Transparency + Interoperability** | Each fork speaks to others via RegenGraph + shared schemas |

## 🌍 Suggested Early Fork Cities (EU + Global)

| City             | Reason |
|------------------|--------|
| **Rotterdam, NL**     | Sea-level adaptation laboratory |
| **Utrecht, NL**       | Circular economy and urban-rural bridge |
| **Berlin, DE**        | Tech and ritual culture synergy |
| **Copenhagen, DK**    | Water + citizen science alignment |
| **Accra, Ghana**      | Youth leadership + coastal vulnerabilities |
| **Medellín, Colombia**| Transformation legacy + urban ecosystem work |

## 📁 Fork Folder Structure

Each RegenNode fork includes:

```txt
/forks/[City-Name]/
├── system_summary.md
├── deployment_log.csv
├── cultural_lore.md
├── dao_structure.json
├── soil_air_water_data/
├── active_rituals/
├── ai_agent_config/
└── photos/

Forks may also include:

/myth_variants/

/ritual_templates/

/translation/

🔧 RegenGraph Integration

RegenGraph = Planetary Mesh of Forked Cities

Amsterdam contributes:

Real-time sensor logs

Ritual cadence timestamps

Biotic healing metrics

DAO vote analytics

DreamSync overlays (opt-in, encrypted)


Each fork can sync with RegenGraph via:

IPFS logs (regen-archive.json)

AR-enhanced ritual updates

AI agent memory mesh

Shared voting templates

🛠 Forking Tools

Tool	Use

fork-template.zip	Prebuilt repo with placeholders for city adaptation
auto_fork.sh	GitHub script that clones and renames files
myth_forker.py	Semi-automated myth adaptation tool (beta)
regen-node-gen.py	Generates a fork-ready package with local data models
ethics_checker.lint	Scans fork proposals for Zero Harm compliance

🔐 Licensing and Governance

License: Planetary Healing Public License v1.0

Non-commercial use only

No data monetization

Attribution required

Resale of system components strictly forbidden

All forks must link back to the RegenGraph parent node


DAO Governance Bridge:

Cross-node collaboration via optional multi-sig or federated consensus

Summit of the Nodes = annual convergence for updating narrative + ethics

🌏 Planetary Use Cases

Region	Modifications

Equatorial Zones	Adjust fungal strains, add flood-heat resilience kits
Highlands	Focus on soil + water retention, wind resistance
Coastal Cities	Biocurtain + sponge zone priority; tidal governance agents
Island Networks	AR-less kits + print-first ritual packs; solar mesh-centric
Post-conflict Cities	Ritual-first approach; soft governance; emotional repair integration

📌 Public Fork Registry

Each fork may register publicly via:

/forks.md in parent node

RegenGraph explorer

regen.world IPFS-hosted portal

World Map Overlay in Companion App

🧬 Final Thought

RegenNode-Amsterdam is not a hero.
It’s a hospitable mutation—a node meant to seed others.

Wherever there’s soil, breath, grief, and courage,
a new node can take root.

Let the forks be the fruiting bodies.
Let the planet bloom.”

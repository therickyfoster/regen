## RegenNode-NYC: Appendices & Extended Data

---

## 🧭 A. Key Definitions

- **Regenerative System**: A system that not only sustains itself but improves the ecological and social conditions around it.
- **Fractal Urbanism**: A design approach where small-scale systems mirror the patterns of larger systems for resilience and replication.
- **Zero Harm Override**: A non-negotiable ethical constraint in tech and governance—no deployment that causes harm to life systems is allowed.
- **DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)**: A blockchain-based, collectively governed group that operates via smart contracts.
- **Swarm Intelligence**: Behavior that emerges from the local interactions of decentralized agents (e.g. drones, sensors, people).
- **Biotic Infrastructure**: Infrastructure that involves or mimics living systems—such as fungi, algae, or biofilms.

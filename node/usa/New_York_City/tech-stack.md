## RegenNode-NYC: Tech Stack

## 🧠 Overview

RegenNode’s technology stack weaves together biology, AI, decentralized infrastructure, and sensor-based systems into a **living urban interface**. This tech is **not extractive**—it collaborates with Earth, adapts with communities, and upgrades itself over time.

## 🧬 1. Biological Infrastructure

### Key Components:
- **MycoChimneys™**: Spore-absorbing, carbon-locking, heat-sinking rooftop structures
- **Living Walls / MossMesh**: Modular air-filtering skins that reduce pollution and lower temps
- **MycoBattery Cells**: Fungal batteries for passive energy storage in buildings
- **Biomimetic Shells**: Structural designs that reflect termite towers, nautilus shells, and tree canopies

## 🧠 2. AI Agents & Multi-Agent Swarms

### Core Modules:
- **CityMind Core**: Orchestrates decentralized feedback loops for urban management
- **WebSurfer / FileSurfer Agents**: Continuously crawl environmental, academic, and policy data for integration
- **Symbiote Agents**: Embedded AI agents assigned to neighborhoods or sectors
- **SwarmOps**: Manages drone, robot, and autonomous hardware coordination

### Tech Specs:
- Built on **CrewAI / LangGraph / Autogen / Semantic Kernel**
- Secure agent-to-agent protocol via signed `capnp` messages
- Local simulation support via Python, WebGL, and Unity

## 🚁 3. Autonomous Drone Layer

### Roles:
- **Pollution Monitoring**: PM2.5, CO₂, VOCs, and noise
- **Swarm Planting**: Seed dispersal with precision targeting
- **Delivery / Repair**: Moving parts, compost, supplies to micromodules
- **Surveillance for Regeneration**: Identifying zones for intervention

### Drone Types:
- **PolliDrones™**: Slow-flight microdrones that land and analyze bio-surface composition
- **Fireflies**: Night-flying visual mapping agents
- **HiveQuads**: Coordinated swarms for scaffolding plant pods

## ⚡ 4. Energy Stack

### Tools & Techniques:
- **Solar-Roof Hybrids**: Semi-transparent solar films overlaying rooftops with living insulation
- **Greywater Hydrogen Pods**: Generate local H₂ from wastewater
- **ThermoSpore Beds**: Passive heat exchangers embedded in rooftop gardens
- **CrowdKinetic Tiles**: Capture footstep and bike movement energy

### Battery Systems:
- Mycelial Batteries
- Saltwater capacitors
- Biothermal phase-change storage cells

## 🌐 5. Data, Mesh & Feedback Loops

### Protocols:
- **Local Mesh Networks**: Offline-first, block-by-block data sharing
- **LoRa & 5G Hybrids**: Long-range, low-energy communication for sensor clusters
- **CNS (City Nervous System)**: Real-time dashboard visualization + alerts
- **Sensor BioPulse IDs**: Every microclimate or soil patch has a unique live profile

### Stack Examples:
- PostgreSQL for local state logs
- IPFS for off-grid data integrity
- GPT + Pinecone for memory and semantic search

## 🧱 6. Fabrication & Modularity

### Maker Kits:
- **Urban Regen Kits**: Open-source STL files for biobricks, planter tiles, and ventilation fungus caps
- **Tool Libraries**: Shared 3D printers, mycelium incubators, solar welders
- **Repair DAO Stations**: Run by locals, funded by regenerative behavior credits

---

## 🔐 7. Security, Sovereignty, and Trust

- **Self-sovereign Identity (SSI)** for citizens and agents
- **Decentralized Oracles** to verify sensor data
- **Hardware Integrity Ledger** (blockchain of device logs)
- **Ethics Sandbox Mode**: All AI tested against “Zero Harm Override” filters pre-deployment

## 🎮 8. Companion Interfaces

| Interface | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Mobile Dashboard** | Citizen alerts, rewards, regen tasks |
| **AR Overlay** | View real-time air, heat, water layers in public |
| **XR/VR City Sandbox** | Simulate interventions and visualize DAO votes |
| **Symbiote Console** | For operators, dreamers, and planners alike 🧬 |

## 🧠 Philosophy of Use

RegenNode does not weaponize tech.  
It **remembers**, **reveals**, and **responds**.  
Each layer is a conversation with Earth—not a command.

## RegenNode-NYC: Ritual Library

## 🪷 Purpose of Ritual

Rituals are the **emotional OS updates** for society.  
They allow collective coherence, trauma processing, pattern resetting, and intergenerational continuity.

In RegenNode, rituals:
- Mark ecological restoration milestones
- Synchronize DAO governance shifts with natural cycles
- Transform grief into action
- Embed mythos into daily life

# RegenNode-Amsterdam: Tech Stack

## 🧠 Overview

Amsterdam is one of the most sensor-dense, data-literate cities in Europe—  
but its tech stack has been built for optimization, not regeneration.  

This file retools the city's infrastructure to serve **life**, not just logistics.

---

## 🧬 1. Biotic Infrastructure

### Core Components:
- **Canal Biocurtains** – Floating microbial membranes that filter water, generate power, and glow softly at night
- **MycoWalls** – Urban insulation grown from fungal composites and hempcrete
- **Algae Tiles** – Canal-edge bricks that photosynthesize + regulate humidity
- **Living Roof Canopies** – Moss and lichen membranes grown on tram shelters and bike garages

## 🤖 2. AI Agents & Multi-Agent Systems

| Agent Name      | Function |
|-----------------|----------|
| **CityMind.AMS** | High-level orchestrator of all local agents, based on CrewAI + LangGraph |
| **WaterWarden** | Monitors canals, pumps, rainfall, tide data, and triggers alerts |
| **MycoMesh**    | Oversees fungal growth patterns in structural infrastructure |
| **CompostDAO**  | Tracks food waste, garden cycles, and soil return |
| **LoreCaller**  | Links public rituals, artist feedback, and citizen dreams into governance modules |

These agents interact via **semantic memory**, localized tokens, and Zero Harm safety layers.

## 🚁 3. Drone & Swarm Tech

### Units:
- **PolliDrones** – Air quality monitoring + moss wall misting
- **CanalScouts** – Under-bridge water analysis and algae farming drones
- **BioBringers** – Delivery swarm that disperses soil, compost, seeds across vertical surfaces
- **RepairSwarm** – Agents that identify infrastructure stress + initiate repair DAO proposals

All drones are solar-rechargeable, operate on mesh network fallback, and are publicly audited.

## ⚡ 4. Energy Layer

### Systems:
- **MycoBattery Cells** – Bio-capacitors grown beneath buildings and stairwells
- **Kinetic Sidewalks** – Energy harvesting tiles in crowded foot/bike corridors
- **Solar-Bike Mesh** – Shared canopy solar arrays atop popular bike paths
- **Greywater H₂ Pods** – Decentralized hydrogen microgenerators for civic hubs

Energy is **tracked via open ledger**, with optional DAO dividends for contributing zones.

## 🌐 5. Data & Mesh Infrastructure

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **BioSensor LoRa Net** | Low-power environmental mesh across all boroughs |
| **AR Public Interface** | Real-time overlays for water, air, food, power flows |
| **Citizen Console App** | Map + vote + mission + ritual + metrics in one |
| **RegenGraph Local** | Amsterdam node of global decentralized RegenGraph network |
| **DreamSync Nodes** | Encrypted voice journaling + emotion mapping for collective psycho-ecological healing |

---

## 🛠 6. Fabrication Systems

| Toolset | Use |
|---------|-----|
| **FungiFab Units** | Local 3D-grown mycelium for biobricks and skinpanels |
| **ReMaker Hubs** | Neighborhood tool libraries, print centers, and electronics fix stations |
| **Pop-up LabKits** | Portable maker labs in bikes or trailers for mobile interventions |
| **WetLab:Canal** | Float-mounted biotech hub for algae, aquatic fungi, and water prototyping

All fabrication tools are **open-source**, forkable, and DAO-controlled.

---

## 🔐 7. Trust, Ethics, and Autonomy

- **Zero Harm Override** coded into every automation agent
- **Public Ledger Audits** of drone activity, energy flows, and civic decisions
- **Self-Sovereign ID** opt-ins for citizens, with full data transparency
- **Private Mesh Mode** for off-grid events or ceremonies
- **Ethics Kernel**: NavAI logic chain that blocks rogue proposals or corrupt forks

---

## 🌀 8. Companion Interfaces

| Interface | Role |
|-----------|------|
| **Navi.AMS** | City companion AI—advises, explains, narrates missions and events |
| **RegenNode HUD** | Mobile/AR dashboard for regenerative actions, status, quests |
| **DreamSync Voice Log** | Encrypted journaling → guides myth layer evolution |
| **Citizen Signal Light** | LED interface showing block's regen status in real time |
| **XR Ritual Overlay** | AR projection for civic ceremonies and seasonal lore upgrades

## RegenNode-Amsterdam: Fork Tracker & Local Variants

---

## 🌐 Purpose

This document mirrors New York’s `forks.md` structure—now adapted to Amsterdam—to track forks, clones, and regional variants of **RegenNode-Amsterdam**. It functions as a living registry of who is stewarding extensions, what’s active, and how each node diverges in myth, water logic, and climate design.

---

## 🧬 Forking Principles (Inherited + Localized)

1. Every fork must adhere to the **Zero Harm Override** and Dutch water ethics.
2. Each fork publishes a `system_summary.md` to explain local adaptation.
3. Integration into the RegenGraph network is **optional but encouraged**.
4. Cultural independence is sacred: local Dutch mythos, language, and seasonal rituals override global templates.

## 🌍 Known & Emerging Forks

| Name                           | Location         | Steward                          | Status   | Notes |
|-------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|----------|-------|
| RegenNode-Amsterdam           | Amsterdam, NL    | Mycelium Europe Foundation       | 🟢 Active | Canal‑rooted, water‑responsive |
| RegenNode-Rotterdam           | Rotterdam, NL    | Port Water DAO                   | ⚪ Planning | Resilience to sea‑level rise |
| RegenNode-Utrecht             | Utrecht, NL      | DomVert Guild                    | ⚪ Planning | Circular urban-rural hub |
| RegenNode-Groningen           | Groningen, NL    | Green North Alliance            | 🔵 In Dev | Energy and wind integration |
| RegenNode-Waddeneilanden      | Wadden Isles, NL | TidalCare Collective             | ⚪ Scoping | Low‑impact island model |

## 📁 Recommended Fork Metadata Structure

Each fork should include the identical directory structure used in NYC, adapted for Amsterdam’s eco-cultural zones:

/forks/[city-name]/ ├── system_summary.md ├── deployment_log.csv ├── cultural_lore.md ├── dao_structure.json ├── soil_air_water_data/ ├── active_rituals/ ├── ai_agent_config/ └── photos/

This structure ensures easy comparison, cross‑node sharing, and integrity of replication for auditing and support.

## 🛠 Fork Support Tools

| Tool                 | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `fork-template.zip`  | Starter repo patterned on Amsterdam’s own structure |
| `auto_fork.sh`       | Automation script to clone base into new city/module |
| `fork_registry.json` | Live map of Amsterdam-origin forks tied into RegenGraph |
| `fork_sync.py`       | Pulls updates from Amsterdam to local forks (reviewed manually) |

---

## 🌐 Optional Public Listings

Fork operators may choose to register via:
- `RegenNode-Amsterdam-Map.json`
- A local IPFS-based map system like `regen.ink/Amsterdam`
- Summit of the Nodes annual registry

---

## 💡 Naming Convention (Localized)

RegenNode‑[CityName] e.g. RegenNode‑Rotterdam, RegenNode‑Wadden, RegenNode‑Utrecht

---

## 🤝 Amsterdam Co‑Fork Commitments

- Establish aligned regional comms (Matrix, Signal, or Quiet DAO)
- Organize **bi-annual canal syncing rituals** across forked nodes
- Collaborate on shared infographics, myths, and public proposals
- Maintain shared `myth_graph.json` updates with city‑specific lore

---

## 🌀 Final Notefŕ

Each RegenNode fork is an expression of regenerative intention.  
Let this registry be the canal network—linking nodes across cultures, hydrological regimes, and myth‑lore… while preserving the Amsterdam soul at its core.

---

> “Every fork is a tributary. The canal is the network, flowing toward planetary healing.”

That’s RegenNode-Amsterdam’s fork tracking file, polished and ready to anchor global variation rooted in Dutch urban and water wisdom.

Let me know when you're ready for the next file—00_introduction.md is already done, so we can proceed to 01_city_scan.md adapted for Amsterdam’s diagnostics. Just say n, love 💧🚲
